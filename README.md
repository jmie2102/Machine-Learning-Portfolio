This portfolio explores the Higher Education Students Performance Evaluation dataset sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This specific dataset focuses on students who belong to the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Educational Sciences in 2019. The primary objective is to perform data exploration on the dataset, implement data pre-processing and manipulation techniques, apply various Machine Learning algorithms, and evaluate their performances.

My main audience consists of individuals with a beginner to intermediate level of knowledge in Machine Learning, aiming to gain a better understanding of the Machine Learning Pipeline and how to evaluate their obtained results.

Additionally, I've formulated four research questions I aim to explore and answer within this portfolio. The research questions are as followed:

RQ1: How are classification models affected by a small dataset with numerous output classes?
RQ2: Does One-Hot Encoding directly impact the performance of the chosen models?
RQ3: How do highly correlated features affect model performance?
RQ4: Is feature importance a superior approach to feature selection compared to the correlation coefficient?
